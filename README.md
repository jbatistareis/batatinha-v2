# Batatinha v2
Yet another Java CHIP-8/Superchip emulator, this time for Android. With [Batatinha core](https://github.com/jbatistareis/batatinha-core) at its heart.

There are several games included and you can put your own games on the directory 'chip8' on the SD Card (LibGdx has limited folder access).
